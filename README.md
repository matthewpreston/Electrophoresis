Molecular Weight Interpolation of Bands

Electrophoresis.R is an R script for quickly compiling the molecular weights of unknown bands from a gel electrophoresis into a presentable figure. It elucidates the exponential regression equation from provided molecular weight ladder data and from this, plots the appropriate interpolated weight for each band. Additionally, bands can be clustered by lanes, allowing for a colourful comparison.
